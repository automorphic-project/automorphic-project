Some conventions regarding the bibliography (my.bib):

* Each key = value pair on one line

* always use {}, no ""

* make sure to use -- dashes in pages

* write fields in caps

* use the biblatex way of JOURNAL and SHORTJOURNAL

* use EPRINT and EPRINTTYPE according to biblatex:
  this gives the best results, in case you decide to stick to bibtex it's
  easy to parse these

* AUTHOR is specified by the format "Family name, First name(s)", and
  whenever a second name is used it's spelt completely

* I haven't decided yet on an indentation format

* make the types (the @book etc) consistent. As the fields are in
  uppercase already, this should be uppercase too
